---

# Perceivable

---

### Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

---

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">
    <i class="fa fa-trash"></i>
</button>
```

---

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">
    <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> Remove
</button>
<!-- or -->
<button class="btn btn-primary" aria-label="Remove">
    <i class="fa fa-trash"></i>
</button>
```

---

```html
<img class="img-responsive" src="xyz.png" />
```

---

```html
<img
    class="img-responsive"
    alt="An image of XYZ"
    src="xyz.png" />
```

---

*_NOT_*

```html
<img
    class="img-responsive"
    alt="xyz.png"
    src="xyz.png" />
```

---

## Provide alternatives for time-based media

Provide captions or transcripts for your audio/visual content. Sign language for live events.

---

## Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure

Semantic structure matters! Tab order matters!

---

import pourWithCss from './img/pour_with-css.png'

<img src={pourWithCss} />

---

import pourWoCss from './img/pour_wo-css.png'

<img src={pourWoCss} />

---

## Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background

---

```html
<div class="alert alert-danger">
    This is some text
</div>
```

---

```html
<div class="alert alert-danger">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i>
    This is some text
</div>
```

---

## Focus

Does the element have a focus state that clearly indicates that it is currently in focus?

If your page refreshes data, does it retain focus on the right data?

---

import colorContrast from './img/color-contrast.png'

## Contrast

## WCAG 2.0 AA: 4.5:1 / 3.1 (large text)

<img src={colorContrast} />

---

# Operable

---

## Make all functionality available from a keyboard

---

```jsx
<img onClick={() => this.props.callback()} />
```

---

```jsx
<img
    onClick={/* ... */}
    onKeyPress={(event) => 
        event.key === 'Enter' && this.props.callback()}
/>
```

---

## Provide users enough time to read and use content

---

## Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures

---

## Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

<ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', paddingLeft: '0' }}>
    <Appear>
        <li>Semantic headings: one <em>h1</em> per page, decrement headings</li>
        <li>Labels on form elements</li>
        <li>Use of <em>&lt;main /></em>, <em>&lt;section /></em>, and <em>&lt;article /></em></li>
        <li>"Skip to" or "Skip Navigation" links</li>
    </Appear>
</ul> 

---

# Understandable

---

## Make text content readable and understandable

---

Set a language on your page!

`<html lang="en">`

---

Or mark individual bits as another language:

`<span lang="fr">C'est la vie</span> isn't in English.`

---

Use `<abbr>` when applicable

---

## Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways

<ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', paddingLeft: '0' }}>
    <Appear>
        <li>Manage focus state, especially in SPA's</li>
        <li>Consistent navigation</li>
        <li>Don't change the interface without user input ...</li>
        <li>... or change the interface while users are interacting with it</li>
    </Appear>
</ul> 

---

## Help users avoid and correct mistakes

<ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', paddingLeft: '0' }}>
    <Appear>
        <li>Error identification (borders, colors, etc.)</li>
        <li>Error suggestions (how to correct the issue)</li>
        <li>Contextual help</li>
        <li>Data entry should be <em>reversible</em>, <em>checked</em>, and <em>confirmed</em></li>
    </Appear>
</ul>
